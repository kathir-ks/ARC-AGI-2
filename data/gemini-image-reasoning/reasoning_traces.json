Its top-left corner is at (10, 0), and it has a height of 10 and a width of 4. This grey color is unique and does not appear in the colorful pattern or the output. This suggests it's a special marker or instruction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Output Grid:**\n    *   The output grid is much smaller, with dimensions 9x3.\n    *   It contains a colorful pattern. The colors used (pink, blue, brown, yellow, orange, red) are all present in the input grid's main pattern.\n\n3.  **Find the Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The transformation involves a significant reduction in size and selecting specific information from the input. It's not a simple scaling or filtering operation.\n    *   The presence of the unique grey rectangle and the symmetry of the main pattern are the most prominent clues. Let's hypothesize that the grey rectangle acts as a pointer or an instruction.\n    *   Given the symmetry, a natural operation is to reflect the position of the grey rectangle across the central vertical axis.\n    *   The grey rectangle's bounding box is `(x=0, y=10, width=4, height=10)`.\n    *   The input grid width is 20. The axis of symmetry is between columns 9 and 10.\n    *   Reflecting the grey rectangle's bounding box across this axis gives us a new target region. The y-coordinate and dimensions remain the same. The new x-coordinate will be `grid_width - (original_x + original_width) = 20 - (0 + 4) = 16`.\n    *   This points to a target region in the input grid starting at `(x=16, y=10)` with a `width=4` and `height=10`. Let's call this the \"source region\". This corresponds to the subgrid `input[10:20, 16:20]`.\n\n4.  **Extracting the Output from the Source Region:**\n    *   Let's examine the pixels in this source region `input[10:20, 16:20]` and compare them to the 9x3 output grid.\n    *   Comparing the top-left 9x3 portion of the source region with the output grid reveals a perfect match.\n    *   `Source_Region[0:9, 0:3]` is identical to `Output[0:9, 0:3]`.\n    *   This leads to the final part of the rule: the dimensions of the output grid are derived from the dimensions of the grey instruction rectangle.\n    *   Output height = `(Grey rectangle height) - 1` = `10 - 1 = 9`.\n    *   Output width = `(Grey rectangle width) - 1` = `4 - 1 = 3`.\n    *   The transformation, therefore, is to find the source region by reflecting the grey marker's position and then to crop a subgrid from the top-left of this source region, with dimensions reduced by one in both height and width.\n\n### Pseudo Code\n\n```pseudocode\nfunction solve(input_grid):\n  // 1. Identify the unique marker object (the grey rectangle).\n  marker_color = find_unique_non_pattern_color(input_grid)\n  marker_pixels = find_all_pixels_with(input_grid, marker_color)\n  \n  // 2. Determine the bounding box of the marker.\n  marker_bbox = get_bounding_box(marker_pixels)\n  // marker_bbox will have properties: x, y, width, height.\n  // In the example: x=0, y=10, width=4, height=10.\n\n  // 3. Get the dimensions of the input grid.\n  grid_width = get_width(input_grid)\n  \n  // 4. Calculate the coordinates of the source region by reflecting the marker's box\n  //    across the vertical centerline of the grid.\n  source_x = grid_width - (marker_bbox.x + marker_bbox.width)\n  source_y = marker_bbox.y\n  \n  // 5. Determine the dimensions of the final output grid.\n  output_width = marker_bbox.width - 1\n  output_height = marker_bbox.height - 1\n  \n  // 6. Create a new grid for the output.\n  output_grid = create_grid(output_width, output_height)\n  \n  // 7. Copy the pixels from the top-left of the source region in the input\n  //    to the output grid.\n  for j from 0 to output_height - 1:\n    for i from 0 to output_width - 1:\n      pixel_color = get_pixel(input_grid, source_x + i, source_y + j)\n      set_pixel(output_grid, i, j, pixel_color)\n      \n  return output_grid\n```"}}
